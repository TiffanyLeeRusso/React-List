## React Boilerplate

A React boilerplate for personal use. Initially created from Heroku's [https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack](create-react-buildpack); instructions here: [https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration](https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration).

The app reads in a sample JSON file, displays it, and has functionality to add to the list.

Thanks for stopping by!
